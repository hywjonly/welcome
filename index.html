              Hi, welcome to my webpage. This is Jie Wang. 
              
              I obtained my PhD degree in March 2025, at Federation University Australia, with thesis title "f-vectors and decomposability of polytopes", 
              and was supervised by A/Prof. David Yost, A/Prof. Guillermo Pineda Villavicencio, Prof. Adil Baghirov and Dr. Nargiz Sultanova. 
              Prior to that, I graduated from the bachelor and master program at Beijing Forestry University in mathematics, 
              with bachelor thesis on a defining a polar of convex lattice sets and master thesis on the positive semidefinite form, both supervised by Prof. Lin Si.

              I am currently a sessional/causal teaching staff and a causal research fellow at Deakin University and a causal teaching staff at Monash College. 
              While I am interested in more stable teaching opportunities at Deakin University, I am also looking for postdoc positions. <br />
