<p>Hi, welcome to my homepage. (This page is still under construction)</p>
              
<p>I obtained my PhD degree in March 2025, at Federation University Australia, with thesis title "f-vectors and decomposability of polytopes", 
and was supervised by 
  A/Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Yost-4/research">David Yost</a>, 
  A/Prof. <a href="https://www.guillermo.com.au/">Guillermo Pineda Villavicencio</a>, 
  Prof. <a href="https://federation.edu.au/institutes-and-schools/iiss/staff-profiles/staff-profiles/archive/adil-bagirov">Adil Baghirov</a> and 
  Dr. <a href="https://federation.edu.au/research/find-an-expert/nargiz-sultanova">Nargiz Sultanova</a>. 
Prior to that, I graduated from the bachelor and master program at Beijing Forestry University in mathematics, 
with bachelor thesis on a defining a polar of convex lattice sets and master thesis on the positive semidefinite form, both supervised by Prof. Lin Si.</p>

<p>I am currently doing some sessional teaching and research at Deakin University. 
While I am interested in more stable teaching opportunities at Deakin University, I am very keen to <b> find a  postdoc position or a lecturer/part-time teaching position. </b></p>

<h1 style="font-size:18px;">Research interests</h1>
 <p>My research interests lie in discrete geometry, a little bit about computational geometry,
    a little bit about functional analysis (topics on convex cones or relates to polytopes) and a little bit about theoretical computer science. 
    In discrete geometry, I mostly work on polytopes. Topics about polytopes that I have been focusing on and have made progress are: 
    the decomposability of polytopes and f-vectors of polytopes.</p>

<p>Lower bound results for conditionally decomposable polytopes (joint work with David Yost). accepted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10868">arXiv</a> 
[Description. We're interested in giving the existence of conditionally decomposable polytopes in higher dimensions, and also the minimum number of vertices 
  of a conditionally decomposable polytope. While the latter is not achieved, we narrowed it down to [3d-4, 4d-4]. I enjoyed the discovery of this paper a lot.] </p>
  
  <p>Polytopes with low excess degree (joint work with David Yost and Guillermo Pineda-Villavicencio). accepted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16838">arXiv</a> 
[Description. It is known that polytopes with excess degree in the range [1, d-3] don't exist. We push it further that polytopes with excess degree in the
  range [d+3, 2d-7] don't exist.] </p>
  
  <p>A refined lower bound theorem for d-polytopes with at most 2d vertices (joint work with David Yost and Guillermo Pineda-Villavicencio)
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13399">arXiv</a>
  [Description. This paper serves as an important preliminary result for the paper "A lower bound theorem for d-polytopes with at most 3d-1 vertices" below.] </p>
 
  <p>A lower bound theorem for d-polytopes with 2d+2 vertices (joint work with Guillermo Pineda-Villavicencio, Aholiab Tritama and David Yost). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14294">arXiv</a> 
    [Description. As the title suggests. My contribution to this paper is minor, mainly in the equality analysis on the facets.] </p>

  <p>A lower bound theorem for d-polytopes with at most 3d-1 vertices (joint work with Guillermo Pineda-Villavicencio). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07456">arXiv</a> 
  [Description. The lower bound on the number of k-faces of a d-polytope with d+s (2 &#8804; s &#8804; d) vertices is known, this is Gr&uuml;nbaum's 
  lower bound conjecture, which was proved by Xue. We give the lower bound on the number of k-faces of a d-polytope with 2d+s (1 &#8804; s &#8804; d-1) vertices. 
  This paper is lengthy.] </p>
  
  <p>Characterization of decomposable d-polytopes with 2d+2, 2d+3 vertices, where d &gt; &equals; 4, d &gt; &equals; 5, respectively (joint work with David Yost) in preparation, 
  to appear on arXiv.</p>

 P.S. There are many people in China whose name is "Jie Wang", including a reputational mathematician who works on graph theory (which is not me). However, I believe I am the only "Jie Wang" working
  on polytopes, as far as I am aware of.
