<p>Hi, welcome to my homepage. (This page is still under construction)</p>
              
<p>I obtained my PhD degree in March 2025, at Federation University Australia, with thesis title "f-vectors and decomposability of polytopes", 
and was supervised by A/Prof. David Yost, A/Prof. Guillermo Pineda Villavicencio, Prof. Adil Baghirov and Dr. Nargiz Sultanova. 
Prior to that, I graduated from the bachelor and master program at Beijing Forestry University in mathematics, 
with bachelor thesis on a defining a polar of convex lattice sets and master thesis on the positive semidefinite form, both supervised by Prof. Lin Si.</p>

<p>I am currently a sessional/causal teaching staff and a causal research fellow at Deakin University and a causal teaching staff at Monash College. 
While I am interested in more stable teaching opportunities at Deakin University, I am also <b>looking for postdoc positions.</b></p>

<h1 style="font-size:18px;">Research interests</h1>
 <p>My research interests lie in discrete geometry, a little bit about computational geometry,
    a little bit about functional analysis (topics on convex cones or relates to polytopes) and a little bit about theoretical computer science. 
    In discrete geometry, I mostly work on polytopes. Topics about polytopes that I have been focusing on and have made progress are: 
    the decomposability of polytopes and f-vectors of polytopes.</p>
